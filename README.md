# task_scripts
My attempt to build an end to end template provisioning solution for Windows VM's. Will require a Windows physical machine or a VM capable of nested virtualisation.

## PowerShell
PS Scripts used for executing in VM actions for packer and the Start-TemplateBake which is to be an end to end process for Windows ISO streamlining and template bake.

** There are still a few items to complete, including the PACKER interaction with VMWare rather than Virtualbox.

## Packer
Contains the files needed for testing the packer process. Currently required virtualbox.

## Chef
Safe to ignore - Not got that far yet.
